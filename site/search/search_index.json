Overview of Sommelier DB and Drive Sommelier DB is an open source DB library based on SQLite. In addition to existing SQLite features, it provides functions for public-key searchable encryption (PKSE) as below. 1. A new SQL function to test a keyword encryption of the PKSE scheme. 2. C functions to generate a keyword encryption and a trapdoor of the PKSE scheme. The above functions allow users to have the database (DB) server search for appropriate records in the DB without revealing their search criteria. For more detail about Sommelier DB, see here . Sommelier Drive is a remote file system developed as the first application of Sommelier DB. Stored files and their file paths are encrypted with the public key of the authorized user who has read access to the file. Therefore, other users who do not have read access or the administrator of the server hosting the file system cannot know what files exist and where they are located. Furthermore, legitimate users can generate trapdoors using the user's private key, allowing the server to search for the appropriate file without revealing the search criteria. Its detailed specifications are available here .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#sommelier-db","text":"Open source DB with public-key searchable encryption: discerning encrypted data without knowing the contents, just like a sommelier!","title":"Sommelier DB"},{"location":"#overview-of-sommelier-db-and-drive","text":"Sommelier DB is an open source DB library based on SQLite.

Databases (DBs) play a significant role in today's Internet-based services. For example, online search services manage the data to be searched in a DB, which can be searched efficiently according to the user's query. The more data stored in a DB, however, the more serious the damage of data leakage if that DB is attacked. Notably, this is not a theoretical concern, but a real issue. It is estimated that well-known Internet-based services, e.g., Yahoo, Facebook, and LinkedIn, have leaked over 100 million records [1]. From these cases, we believe that we need a solution that can protect the data confidentiality even if data is leaked from the DB . How public-key searchable encryption establishes both the convenience and security of databases. A primitive solution to the above problem is to encrypt all data in the DB so that its contents cannot be known by an adversary who attacks the DB. However, it would compromise the convenience of the DB because the server hosting the DB cannot search the queried data. We establish both the convenience and security by encrypting the data by public-key searchable encryption (PKSE) . PKSE has the same features as standard public-key encryption schemes, e.g., RSA encryption scheme, except that the secret key holder can allow a third party to test whether the encrypted data satisfies some search criteria, without revealing the data and the search criteria [2]. In more detail, a user who wishes to search for data first generates a pair of secret and public keys. The public key is made available to a data provider who provides some data. The data provider encrypts the data with the user's public key and stores only the encryption on the DB server. The user then generates data corresponding to the user's search criteria, called trapdoor , and sends it to the DB server; the DB server can learn little information from the trapdoor. Since the DB server only receives the encryption and the trapdoor, it can protect the data confidentiality from an adversary who have access to all data in the DB, as well as from a malicious administrator of that server. Furthermore, the server can retrieve the encryption of the queried data using a test algorithm of the PKSE scheme. Formally, that algorithm takes as input encrypted data and a trapdoor and outputs 1 if the data satisfies the search criteria for the provided trapdoor and 0 otherwise . The server applies it to all candidate encryptions with the provided trapdoor and returns to the user only those encryptions for which it returns 1. In this way, the user can have the DB server search for apposite data as before. Sommelier DB: the world's first open source database based on public-key searchable encryption. Following the approach described above, we propose a new PKSE-based DB library, Sommelier DB. While the PKSE-based DB has been considered in various studies [2-5], as far as our knowledge there are no open source implementations other than ours. Sommelier DB is a fork of SQLite: it adds the following two functions: 1. A new SQL function for the test algorithm of the PKSE scheme. 2. C functions to generate a keyword encryption and a trapdoor of the PKSE scheme. These functions allow you to enjoy the benefits of PKSE without understanding how it works! Reference Todd, D.
