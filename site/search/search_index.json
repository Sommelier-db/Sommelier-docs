Databases (DBs) play a significant role in today's Internet-based services. For example, online search services manage the data to be searched in a DB, which can be retrieved efficiently according to the user's query. However, the more data stored in a DB, the more serious the damage of data leakage if that DB is attacked. Notably, this is not a theoretical concern, but a real issue. In fact, it is estimated that popular Internet-based services, e.g., Yahoo, Facebook, and LinkedIn, have leaked over 100 million records [1]. From these cases, we believe that we need a solution that can protect the data confidentiality even if data is leaked from the DB . How public-key searchable encryption establishes both the convenience and security of databases. A primitive solution to the above problem is to encrypt all data in the DB so that its contents cannot be known by an adversary who attacks the DB. However, it would compromise the convenience of the DB because the server hosting the DB cannot search for the queried data. We establish both the convenience and security by encrypting the data by public-key searchable encryption (PKSE) . PKSE has the same features as standard public-key encryption schemes, e.g., RSA encryption scheme, except that the private key holder can allow a third party to test whether the encrypted data satisfies some search criteria, without revealing the data and the search criteria [2]. In more detail, a user who wishes to search for data first generates a pair of secret and public keys. The public key is made available to a data provider who provides some data. The data provider encrypts the data with the user's public key and stores only the encryption on the DB server. The user then generates data corresponding to the user's search criteria, called trapdoor , and sends it to the DB server; the DB server can learn little information from the trapdoor. Since the DB server only receives the encryption and the trapdoor, it can protect the data confidentiality from an adversary who have access to all data in the DB, as well as from a malicious administrator of that server. Furthermore, the server can retrieve the encryption of the queried data using a test algorithm of the PKSE scheme. Formally, that algorithm takes as input encrypted data and a trapdoor and outputs 1 if the data satisfies the search criteria for the provided trapdoor and 0 otherwise . The server applies it to all candidate encryptions with the provided trapdoor and returns to the user only those encryptions for which it returns 1. In this way, the user can have the DB server search for apposite data as before. Sommelier DB: the world's first open source database based on public-key searchable encryption. Following the approach described above, we propose a new PKSE-based DB library, Sommelier DB. While the PKSE-based DB has been considered in various studies [2-5], as far as our knowledge there are no open source implementations other than ours. Sommelier DB is a fork of SQLite: it adds the following two functions: A new SQL function for the test algorithm of the PKSE scheme. C and Rust functions to generate a keyword encryption and a trapdoor of the PKSE scheme. These functions allow you to enjoy the benefits of PKSE without understanding how it works! Reference Todd, D.

As the first application of Sommelier DB, we developed a new remote file system, Sommelier Drive. Like existing services, such as Dropbox, Google Drive, and One Drive, files can be stored on a remote server, but the file contents and their file paths are all encrypted. Therefore, even a malicious administrator of that server cannot know what files exist and where they are located . In a nutshell, a data provider who creates a new file, a user who has read permission to that file, and the remote server work as below. The data provider encrypts the file contents and paths with the user's public key and stores their encryptions on the remote server. The user generates a trapdoor of the PKSE scheme with the user's private key and provides it for the remote server. The remote server returns the file contents encryption of which the corresponding file path encryption matches with the provided trapdoor. The user decrypts the returned encryption with the user's private key, which results in the file contents. The above scheme may seem almost the same as the Sommelier DB. The difference is that the user's private and public keys consist of those of PKSE and public-key encryption (PKE). The PKSE scheme is used to allow the server to search for files in the queried file path without revealing them. In addition, the PKE scheme is necessary to obtain the file contents because only with the PKSE scheme the user cannot obtain the unknown message from the ciphertext, even if the PKSE private key is available. In other words, Sommelier Drive requires the PKSE and PKE scheme to test and recover the file path and contents, respectively.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"drive/intro/#storing-files-on-a-remote-server-without-revealing-what-files-exist-and-where-they-are-located","text":"As the first application of Sommelier DB, we developed a new remote file system, Sommelier Drive.

Permission hash for the optimization of file path testing on the remote server. First, we introduce a permission hash. This is a hash value calculated from the ID of a legitimate user having read permission and the file path of the parent directory. The data provider, in addition to the file path encryption, stores the permission hash on the remote server. When querying a file, the user also provides the remote server with the permission hash corresponding to the queried file path, allowing the remote server to narrow down the candidates for file path encryptions to test. In this way, the permission hash optimizes the file path testing on the remote server. The attentive reader may think that the permission hash helps the malicious server administrator learn information about the file path. In fact, it reveals only information about sibling files and directories, i.e., those contained in the same parent directory . This is because the administrator cannot learn the actual file paths from their permission hash or encryptions but can specify the siblings by comparing the permission hashes. Shared key for the optimization of encrypting a file for multiple users. A shared key is just a secret key of symmetric key encryption (SKE), e.g., AES. It improves the efficiency when multiple users have read permission for the same file. In more detail, the file contents are encrypted with a fresh shared key, and the shared key is encrypted with each user's PKE public key. The legitimate user can obtain the file contents by (1) recovering the shared key with the PKE private key and (2) decrypting the SKE ciphertexts with the shared key. To analyze the efficiency, we compare the ciphertext size in the above scheme with that of the case where the file contents are directly encrypted with each user's PKE public key. Let \\(N, d, k\\) be the number of the legitimate users, the file contents size, and the shared key size. In the former case, the ciphertext size grows in the order \\(\\mathcal{O}(kN)\\) , whereas the order of the latter case is \\(\\mathcal{O}(dN)\\) . Therefore, our scheme is more efficient when \\(d\\) is sufficiently large.","title":"New Concepts"},{"location":"drive/how_it_works/concepts/#permission-hash-for-the-optimization-of-file-path-testing-on-the-remote-server","text":"First, we introduce a permission hash.
