A client of Sommelier Drive can manage files on the remote server in a similar manner to Unix file systems. While our current implementation provides two types of client CLI, both of them perform each operation in the background as below.

## User registration
## File/Directory acquisition (touch)
## Children file paths acquisition (ls)
## Descendant file paths acquisition (find)
## File creation (touch)
## Directory creation (mkdir)
## File Modification


**Note that the other operations, e.g., file deletion, are not supported in the current implementation**.
