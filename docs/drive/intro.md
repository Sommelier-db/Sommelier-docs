## Storing files on a remote server without revealing what files exist and where they are located.
As the first application of Sommelier DB, we developed a new remote file system, Sommelier Drive. Like existing services, such as Dropbox, Google Drive, and One Drive, files can be stored on a remote server, but the contents of the files and their file paths are all encrypted. Therefore, **even a malicious server administrator of that server cannot know what files exist and where they are located**.
